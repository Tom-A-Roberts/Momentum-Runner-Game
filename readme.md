# Momentum-based running game 🏃
**Thomas Roberts 🎮, Jonathan Watts 👾, Oscar Rummery 🔬**
## Introduction ⚡
A group-created game made by a bunch of friends.
Not just to gain experience working together, but also to make a game we can actually enjoy ourselves.
## Idea 💡
A combination of various first-person movement mechanics combined with the ability to retain your momentum as you go. This will be a multiplayer game where you may be running from AI's in a co-operative manner, or simply racing your friends to the finish line.
